# LaTeX2Futhark
This is a very early-stage transpiler for generating Futhark code based on LaTeX math inputs. There are currently some important limitations in the existing implementation (i.e., products and complex expressions with nesting), and the parsing currently requires the use of specific LaTeX syntax. The generated code often has suboptimal performance.
